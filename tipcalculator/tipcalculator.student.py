# Tip Calculator

# Ask the user what their bill was:
bill_amount = int(raw_input("  [replace me with a question]  "))

# Ask the user what percent they will tip their waiter with:
tip_percent = int(raw_input("  [replace me with a question]  "))

# Multiply the tip_percent by the bill_amount:
#   (Note: As the user, will you enter the tip_percent as a
#    whole number or as a decimal?  We will assume as a whole number)
tip =

print "This is your tip:"
# print the tip on the next line:


print "This is the total amount you pay:"
# print the bill_amount plus the tip
